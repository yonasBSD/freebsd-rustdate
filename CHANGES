= freebsd-rustdate changelog


== 0.6.1  (2024-08-22)

* Further code cleanups and reorganization.

* Improve some output cosmetics.


== 0.6.0  (2024-08-21)

* Add `check-fetch` command to quickly check whether we seem to be on the
  latest patchlevel.

* Improve command and option help.

* Various code and comment rearrangement and cleanup.


== 0.5.0  (2024-08-20)

* Add `cron` command to run with a variable sleep from cron, and email
  the config'd MailTo when there's something to do.


== 0.4.0  (2024-08-18)

* Add `extract` command to extract exact upstream values of given paths.
  This is intended to be used for manual spot cleanups of differences
  identified by `check-sys` that you don't want to actually differ.  It
  has few guardrails and is intended to do exactly what you say, so use
  it with caution.

* When ignoring hash difference, `check-sys` will no longer compute the
  hashes of the files, which saves a lot of time.


== 0.3.1  (2024-08-15)

* The `check-sys` command has gained `--path` and `--exclude` arguments
  to limit the paths checked, and the output format is cosmetically
  adjusted.

* KeepModifiedMetadata now properly ignores uid/gid when running as
  non-root.  This is necessary because otherwise you'd miss out on a file
  mode changing across versions.

* Doing an upgrade from a non-latest-patchlevel is a bit more robust now.


== 0.3.0  (2024-08-14)

* Add `check-sys` command, which checks the state of your system against
  the expected status from upstream.  Fills a similar role to
  freebsd-update.sh's IDS command.


== 0.2.0 (2024-08-13)

First actual release.  Basic functionality available. fetch, upgrade,
install all working in practice.
